# Canvas Scraper

A basic canvas scraper that fetches your courses and upcoming assessments/quizzes and prints them to the console.
The scraped information is also dumped into some JSON files in the CWD.

## Quickstart

- Install dependencies

    ```npm i```

- Build js file

   ```tsc```

- Create a new Canvas access token [here](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/profile/settings) and paste it into a file called `./token`
- Run

    ```node main.js```
